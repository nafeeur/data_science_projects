# Tweet Emotion Recognition with Tensorflow

Created a recurrent neural network that recognizes a emotion in a particular tweet. The model has been trained with data containing thousands of tweets each associated with one of 6 emotions: Sadness, Joy, Love, Fear, Surprise and Anger.

Employed the following tools/methods to successfully complete the project:
    
    Used a Tokenizer in TensorFlow 

    Used Padding and Truncating Sequences

    Created and Trained Recurrent Neural Networks

    Used NLP and Deep Learning to perform Text Classification
